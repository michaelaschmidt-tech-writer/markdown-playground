# In-line formatting for emphasis

## Bold

You can either use asterisks or underscore to format text bold.

For example:<br>
- This word is **bold** and written as `**bold**`.<br>
- This word is also __bold__ but written as `__bold__`.

But if you want to format only certain characters inside of a word as bold, use `**`. `__` is not working.

For example:<br>
- Superlongwordthatneedsa**bold**emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Superlongwordthatneedsa**bold**emphasisinthemiddle`<br>
- Superlongwordthatneedsa__bold__emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Superlongwordthatneedsa__bold__emphasisinthemiddle` (not working)

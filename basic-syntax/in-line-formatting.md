# In-line formatting for emphasis

## Bold

You can either use two asterisks or underscores to format text bold.

**For example:**<br>
- This word is **bold** and written as `**bold**`.<br>
- This word is also __bold__ but written as `__bold__`.

But if you want to format only certain characters inside of a word as bold, use `**`. `__` is not working.

**For example:**<br>
- Superlongwordthatneedsa**bold**emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Superlongwordthatneedsa**bold**emphasisinthemiddle`<br>
- Superlongwordthatneedsa__bold__emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Superlongwordthatneedsa__bold__emphasisinthemiddle` (not working)

## Italic

You can either use one asterisk or underscore to format text italic.

**For example:**<br>
- This word is *italic* and written as `*italic*`.<br>
- This word is also _italic_ but written as `_italic_`.

But if you want to format only certain characters inside of a word as italic, use `*`. `_` is not working.

**For example:**<br>
- Wordthatweirdlyneedsan*italic*emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Wordthatweirdlyneedsan*italic*emphasisinthemiddle`<br>
- Wordthatweirdlyneedsan_italic_emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Wordthatweirdlyneedsan_italic_emphasisinthemiddle` (not working)

## Bold and italic

You can either use three asterisks or underscores to format text both bold and italic.

**For example:**<br>
- This text is ***both bold and italic*** and written as `***both bold and italic***`.<br>
- This text is also ___both bold and italic___ but written as `___both bold and italic___`.

But if you want to format only certain characters inside of a word as both bold and italic, use `***`. `___` is not working.

**For example:**<br>
- Nowherewereallywanttosuperemphasizeas***bothboldanditalic***inthemiddle, written as: `Nowherewereallywanttosuperemphasizeas***bothboldanditalic***inthemiddle`<br>
- Nowherewereallywanttosuperemphasizeas___bothboldanditalic___inthemiddle, written as: `Nowherewereallywanttosuperemphasizeas___bothboldanditalic___inthemiddle` (not working)

# Links

## External links

To create a link, enter the text you want to display in brackets, followed by the actual URL in parentheses.

**For example:**<br>
I am so happy I was able to learn so much about Markdown by reading the `[Markdownguide](https://www.markdownguide.org)`.

**This shows as:**<br>

## Links to Github

You can of course also link to content in Github.

**For example:**<br>
I learned even more by applying markdown in my markdown playground, which you can find here: `[Michaela's markdown playground](https://github.com/michaelaschmidt-tech-writer/markdown-playground)`.

## Tooltips on links

What you can also do is add tooltips that appear when you hover over a link. You enter the content of the tooltip into quotation marks after the URL.

**For example:**<br>
Find examples on how applied markdown looks in `[Michaela's markdown playground](https://github.com/michaelaschmidt-tech-writer/markdown-playground "Here you'll find all the markdowns!")`.

## Formatting links

You can format links basically in the same way as normal text. For more info on in-line formatting, see [in-line formatting](in-line-formatting.md).
- If you want to format a link as bold, type `**[bold link](in-line-formatting.md)**` and you will get: **[bold link](in-line-formatting.md)**.
- If you want to format a link as italic, type `*[italic link](in-line-formatting.md)*` and you will get: *[italic link](in-line-formatting.md)*.

## Paragraphs and lines with blockquotes

Create blockquotes with more than one paragraphs by entering `>` in front of a paragraph, `>` in front of an empty line, and then `>` in front of a new paragraph.

> Like this. This is the first paragraph, then comes and empty line.
>
> And here is the new paragraph.

Create blockquotes with line breaks by entering `>` in front of a line, `<br>` at the end of the line, and then `>` in front of a new line. 

> Like this. This is a line with line break at the end.<br>
> And here is the new line.

This is very similar as "normal" paragraphs and lines, see [Paragraphs and line breaks](basic-syntax/paragraphs-and-line-breaks.md).

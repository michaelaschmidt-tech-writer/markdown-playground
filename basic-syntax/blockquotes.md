## Paragraphs and lines with blockquotes

Create blockquotes with more than one paragraphs by entering `>` in front of a paragraph, `>` in front of an empty line, and then `>` in front of a new paragraph.

> Like this. This is the first paragraph, then comes and empty line.
>
> And here is the new paragraph.

Create blockquotes with line breaks by entering `>` in front of a line, `<br>` at the end of the line, and then `>` in front of a new line. 

> Like this. This is a line with line break at the end.<br>
> And here is the new line.

This is very similar as "normal" paragraphs and lines, see [Paragraphs and line breaks](paragraphs-and-line-breaks.md).

## Nested blockquotes

Create nested blockquotes by entering `>` for the main blockquote as usual, and then `>>` for the nested blockquote and so on.

> This is the main blockquote.
>> And this is the nested blockquote.
>>> How far can we go?
>>>> Forth level?
>>>>> Fifth?
>>>>>> When will this end?
>>>>>>> Is it more than heading levels?
>>>>>>>> Yes it is, in the eighth level already!
>>>>>>>>> Ninth!
>>>>>>>>>> Tenth!
>>>>>>>>>>> Okay, this makes no sense anymore...
>>>>>>>>>>>> Yeah, this was fun but I got tired and asked ChatGPT: levels of blockquotes are unlimited...

## Blockquotes and other elements

Other formatting elements can be used in blockquotes. Not all but some, it seems to be trial and error...

You can use for example:
- Inline formatting bold and italic. See [In-line formatting](in-line-formatting.md).
- Lists [Lists](lists.md).

And it looks like this:
> This is a blockquote.<br>
> It has a list containing these items:
> - Item 1
> - Item 2
> 
> Also it has **bold** text and *italic* text.

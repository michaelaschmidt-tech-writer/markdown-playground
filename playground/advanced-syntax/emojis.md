# Emojis

You can simply copy and paste an emoji from another source, such as [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org), or you can use the emoji shortcodes by typing `:` and the shortcode.

**For example:**<br>
`:whale`<br>
Displays as: 🐳

Tip: When you don't know the shortcode, just start typing and you get some suggestions.

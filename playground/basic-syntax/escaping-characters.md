# Escaping characters

To show characters that otherwise would lead to a markdown format, you can use the backslash.

**For example:**<br>
You type \* followed by a blank and text and it leads to an unnumbered list.<br>
To avoid that, type `\*` and it will show as \*.

Alternatively, you can also write in code. See [code](playground/basic-syntax/code).

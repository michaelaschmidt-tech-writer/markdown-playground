# Headings

There are six heading levels available.

# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6

Always put a blank line before and after a heading. Otherwise, it might break the syntax.<br>
Use `#` and a blank to create a heading level 1 and so on until `######` for a heading level 6.

# Paragraphs

To create a new paragraph, use a blank line. 
Without a blank line in between lines, the text continuse in the same line, like this.

With a blank line in between lines, you get a new paragraph, like this.

# Line breaks

For a line break, you can end a line with two blanks to create a line break.  
Like this.

As this so-called "trailing white space" is hard to see in an editor, you can also write `<br>` at the end of a line.<br>
It also leads to a line break.

# In-line formatting for emphasis

## Bold

You can either use asterisks or underscore to format text bold.

For example:<br>
- This word is **bold** and written as `**bold**`.<br>
- This word is also __bold__ but written as `__bold__`.

But if you want to format only certain characters inside of a word as bold, use `**`. `__` is not working.

For example:<br>
- Superlongwordthatneedsa**bold**emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Superlongwordthatneedsa**bold**emphasisinthemiddle`<br>
- Superlongwordthatneedsa__bold__emphasisinthemiddle, written as: `Superlongwordthatneedsa__bold__emphasisinthemiddle` (not working)
